== Abstract

In this article I will show you how to customize the http://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap style sheets] and compile
them with the https://github.com/houbie/lesscss-gradle-plugin[Lesscss Gradle plugin].

You won't have to change the original sources. You won't even have to download them manually.

I'll also show how you can inspect the LESS sources in your browser (in stead of the generated CSS) and how to get productive
with automatic compilation.

== Quick start

1. If you already have gradle:
+
There's only one file to download: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/houbie/less-bootstrap/master/build.gradle[build.gradle] :) +
Save it in the directory _less-bootstrap_ and then:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd less-bootstrap
gradle init
gradle lesscDaemon --info
----

2. You don't have Gradle yet:
+
Clone the github project with `git clone https://github.com/houbie/less-bootstrap`
or download and unpack the https://github.com/houbie/less-bootstrap/archive/master.zip[zip distribution]
and use the included gradle wrapper:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd less-bootstrap
gradlew init
gradlew lesscDaemon --info
----

Now you can:

. open _less-bootstrap/web/bootstrap-examples/theme/index.html_ (or an other example)
. change _less-bootstrap/web/less/custom-variables.less_
. reload the page to see the changes

TIP: Before reloading the page in your browser, you'll have to wait a few seconds until the style sheets are compiled.
If you don't like waiting (who does?), see <<_speeding_up_compilation>>

== Exploring the examples

The examples are located in _less-bootstrap/web/bootstrap-examples_. When you open f.e. _less-bootstrap/web/bootstrap-examples/theme/index.html_
and inspect the _Learn more_ button in Google Chrome, you will see something like this:

.Inspecting an element in Chrome
image::inspect.png[Inspecting an element in Chrome]

The inspector shows the LESS sources because the the _lessc_ task is configured to generate source maps:

.Enabling source maps in `build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
include::build.gradle[lines=49..60]
----

NOTE: At the moment of writing, Chrome is the only browser that supports source maps for CSS files.
http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/12/28/debug-less-with-chrome-developer-tools/[This blog] shows how to enable CSS source maps
if they are not enabled by default.

== Customizing the style sheet

=== Where is the code?

We would like to change the background color of the _Learn more_ button, but how do we locate its definition?

Again, by inspecting the element in Chrome, we see that the background color is defined in _buttons.less_.

.The button's background colour
image::background-color.png[The button's background colour]

When we double-click _buttons.less_, the source is opened in the inspector:

.Buttons.less
image::buttons-less.png[Buttons.less]

We see that the variable that we need to change is `btn-primary-bg`. Unfortunately, we cannot navigate further anymore
in the inspector, so we have to search manually.

The bootstrap source files can be found in _less-bootstrap/build/bootstrap/web-app/less_. A text search leads us to _mixins.less_
for the `button-variant` definition and to _variables.less_ for the background color variable:

[source,less]
----
@btn-primary-bg: @brand-primary;
----

Albeit not perfect, it is a lot easier to find the code in this way than if we would only see the raw CSS in the inspector.

At this point we have to decide whether we want to change only the color of the primary buttons, or if we want to change
the primary brand color.

=== Modifying styles

There are 3 ways to modify the style sheets:

1. Overwrite variables in _build.gradle_
2. Modify a copy of the original source
3. Create our own customization LESS file

==== Overwriting variables in _build.gradle_

The lesscss compiler allows us to declare new or overwrite existing variables via the commandline or in _build.gradle_:

[source,java]
----
lessc {
    ...
    options.modifyVars = ['brand-primary': 'purple']
}
----

Overwriting variables this way can be useful if you want f.e. to use a different color scheme for development builds than for release builds, but
it is not suitable for more involved customizations.

==== Modify a copy of the original source

The _lessc_ task is configured to lookup LESS files first in _less-bootstrap/web/less_:

[source,java]
----
lessc {
    ...
    sourceDir "$webDir/less", "$buildDir/bootstrap/web-app/less"
}
----

This means that if we would copy _variables.less_ to _less-bootstrap/web/less_ and modify it, it will take precedence over
the original file.

However, when we would like to upgrade to a newer bootstrap version, we would need to apply all our changes again in the
new file, which is far from ideal.

NOTE: Changing `brand-primary` in our copy of _variables.less_ won't have any effect, it will always be overridden by
the value in _build.gradle_!

==== Create our own customization LESS file

The main LESS file, _bootstrap.less_, consists of only import statements. If we would append a few import statements to
include our own customization files, we wouldn't have to change the original LESS code. This is exactly what the _init_
task does when it unpacks the bootstrap sources:

[source,java]
----
//have our custom less files imported into bootstrap.less and theme.less
file("$buildDir/bootstrap/web-app/less/bootstrap.less").text += '''
@import "custom-variables.less";
@import "application.less";'''

file("$buildDir/bootstrap/web-app/less/theme.less").text += '@import "custom-variables.less";'
----

Now you only have to keep the customizations in your project's source repository. Furthermore, switching to another version of
bootstrap becomes trivial.

== Define your own semantics

As pointed out in this http://ruby.bvision.com/blog/please-stop-embedding-bootstrap-classes-in-your-html[blog],
you should use html elements and/or CSS classes that outline the structure of your documents.

_/less-bootstrap/web/less/application.less_ defines a sample article structure that is used in
_less-bootstrap/web/bootstrap-examples/starter-template/semantics.html_.

Again, we are extending bootstrap without changing the original sources.

== Speeding up compilation

Although the https://github.com/houbie/lesscss[lesscss compiler] is the fastest Java LESS compiler, it is still very slow
compared with the original node.js compiler.

Fortunately, you can use the node.js _lessc_ compiler in combination with the Lesscss Gradle Plugin:

[source,java]
----
lesscDaemon {
    engine = 'commandline'
    lessExecutable = '/opt/local/bin/lessc'
}
----

Now, your style sheets will typically be compiled by the time you switched from the source editor to the browser.

The `lessExecutable` is only required when _lessc_ is not on your path. In windows you should include the _.bat_ or _.cmd_ extension.

You can read http://[here] how to install the node.js _lessc_ compiler.

TIP: Use the fast node.js compiler in the _lesscDaemon_ task to save time when developing the style sheets. Keep the default
(java rhino based) compiler in the _lessc_ task to avoid installing node.js on your CI server and to have deterministic
builds that always use the same compiler version.
